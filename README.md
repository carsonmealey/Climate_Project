# MIST 353 Assignment #2
## Project Overview
At this phase of the porject, I have a very basic and simplistic look for my website.  The homepage gives you an introduction and then takes you to my second website where the user input and climate data analysis takes place.  The "Randomize" button will give the user a random NFL team.  The "Submit" button will take the NFL team and the climate that the user chooses, and will display data on how the chosen NFL team plays in the chosen climate.
## Page Descriptions
My first page (Homepage.html) is very simple.  It has an introduction to the user, an explanation of what the web application will do, along with a link to my second page, Index.html.  In Index.html, there is a title, an explanation of what the user should do, and two input boxes.  The first one is for an NFL team and the other is the climate that the user will choose.  Once they hit the submit button, it will show the results of the NFL team and the climate that the user chose.
## Future Enhancements
Here are some of my future enhancements that I plan on implmenting:
- Implementating team and climate data.
- Having both of the buttons functional (Only the team button is functional at the moment).
- Making the website look prettier.
## Citations 
OpenAI and W3Schools were used while maling my prototype.
- Line 2: W3Schools was used to change the color of my "Submit" button.
- Line 11: only: W3Schools used to change the font size of h1.
- Lines 11-30: Online recorded lectures were used for the creation of the table.
- Lines 33-102: ChatGPT was used for my "Randomize" button.  The function takes the list of NFL teams and will randomize the team that is put in the "Team" user input box.  Prompt used was, "I need a JavaScript to return a random NFL team."
## Refelctions on Resources
Resources were a tremendous help during the creation of this prototype.  The online lectures and OpenAI were my favorite to use and were the biggest help in my opinion.  I think that the webistes I researched will help me when we begin to learn how to implement data.  
My resources ranked were:
1. ChatGPT
2. Lecture recordings
3. Website research
